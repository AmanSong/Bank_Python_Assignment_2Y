# Bank_Python_Assignment_2Y

This was my second year final assignment, i was tasked to make a bank system that allows users to register, withdraw and deposit money and their data should be saved in an external text file. Unfortunetly i recieved an intermediatelyy grade for this project as i used global variables for some functions.
